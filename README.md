# 📊 Case iFood - Data Analyst

A well-established food retail company serves nearly one million consumers annually, offering products in five main categories — **wines**, **meats**, **exotic fruits**, **specially prepared fish**, and **sweets** — available in both regular and premium versions.  

Sales channels include **physical stores**, **catalogs**, and the **company’s website**.  

Despite solid financial performance over the past three years, future profit growth projections are not encouraging. To address this, the company is exploring several strategic initiatives — one of which focuses on **improving the performance of marketing campaigns**.

**📁 Data Science Project**  
Based on the selection process for the **Data Analyst** position at **iFood**, available in [this repository](https://github.com/ifood/ifood-data-business-analyst-test).

📄 Complete case description available [here](case/README.md).


 
## **Detailed Objectives:**

- Conduct a robust exploratory data analysis.
- Segment the customers in the provided dataset.
- Build a classification model to predict whether a customer will purchase the product offered in the campaign.
- Present a Data Science project structure, including notebooks, scripts, reports, and a GitHub repository.
- Demonstrate best practices in Python programming, such as using functions and script files to facilitate code reuse.
- Apply best practices with the SciKit-Learn library, including using pipelines and hyperparameter optimization.

## **Repository Structure**

```
├── case
├── data
├── images
├── notebooks
├── reports
```

- The `data` folder contains the data used in the project. The file `ml_project1_data.csv` is the original dataset, and the other files are datasets generated during the project.
- The `images` folder contains the images used in this README.
- The `notebooks` folder contains the notebooks with the project development.
- The `reports` folder contains the reports generated using the [ydata-profiling](https://github.com/ydataai/ydata-profiling) library.

## **Dataset Details and Results Summary**

A detailed description of the dataset used is available [here](data/README.md).

With a pipeline including preprocessing, PCA, and K-Means, the dataset was segmented into 3 clusters:

### **Cluster Analysis:**

- **Cluster 0:** 
  - High income
  - High spending
  - Likely no children
  - More likely to accept campaigns
  - No members with basic education
  - No prominent age group

- **Cluster 1:** 
  - Low income
  - Low spending
  - Likely has children
  - Low propensity to accept campaigns
  - Only cluster with a significant percentage of people with basic education
  - Younger people

- **Cluster 2:** 
  - Mid-range income
  - Mid-range spending
  - Likely has children
  - May accept campaigns
  - Older people

Next, three classification models were trained to predict whether a customer would purchase the product in the campaign. The models used were:

- Logistic Regression
- Decision Tree
- KNN

A **DummyClassifier** was used as a baseline. The models were evaluated based on 6 metrics:

Based on this comparison, the **Logistic Regression** model was chosen for hyperparameter optimization.

## **How to Reproduce the Project**

The project was developed using **Python 3.11.5**. To reproduce the project, create a virtual environment with Conda (or similar tool) using Python 3.11.5 and install the following libraries:

| Library          | Version |
| ---------------- | ------ |
| Imbalanced-Learn | 0.11.0 |
| Matplotlib       | 3.7.2  |
| NumPy            | 1.24.3 |
| Pandas           | 1.5.3  |
| Scikit-Learn     | 1.3.0  |
| Seaborn          | 0.12.2 |

These are the main libraries used in the project. The report was generated using the [ydata-profiling](https://github.com/ydataai/ydata-profiling) library. Install it if you wish to reproduce the report.
